description: Genome annotation for Arachis hypogaea cultivar Tifrunner, generated with the MAKER pipeline, version 2.31.9. Evidence included gene models from Arachis ipaensis and Arachis duranensis and two transcriptome assemblies: one generated as a genome-guided assembly of 22 tissues from Clevenger et al., 2016 (https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2016.01446) and one generated as a genome-guided assembly of 12 libraries from additional tissues and stress conditions (Ozias-Akins et al., unpublished).

file_transformation: 
  - Added prefixes to GFF references and IDs

changes: 
  - 2018-03-01 moved file lists into MANIFESTs
  - 2018-06-25 added descriptions file: arahy.Tifrunner.gnm1.ann1.CCJH.info_descriptors.txt - derived from gff3 file as follows: cat arahy.Tifrunner.gnm1.ann1.CCJH.gene_models_main.gff3 | awk '$3=="gene"' | grep "Name=" | grep Z7AAAI | perl -pe 's/%2C/,/g; s/%3B/;/g; s/%3D/=/g'
  - 2019-05-20 Updated README to note publication
  - 2019-07-25 Updated GFF file to fix problem with parent names in exon records (second and subsequent names within an exon with multiple parents had incorect forms).
  - 2020-04-03 adf updated GFF file to fix lingering issues with shared exons and suppressed transcripts reported by user
