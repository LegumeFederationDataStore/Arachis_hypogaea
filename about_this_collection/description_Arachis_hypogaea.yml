organism.description:	Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) was domesticated at the foot of the South American Andes within modern-day Argentina, Bolivia, or Paraguay. Cultivated peanuts are allotetraploids, with sub-genomes probably contributed by the hybridization of the diploid species Arachis duranensis and Arachis ipaensis.
